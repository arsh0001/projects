This readme is about the overview of the arduino controlled bluetooth door lock.
In this project we have used arduino uno R3,relay(schneider-RXM4LB2P7),bluetooth module(HC-05),servo,jumper wires,battery(9V),adapter(220v to 5V),hinge mechanism.
This project of ours work on domestic power supply and in absence of the electricity it will automatically switches to battery with help of relay.
You can use the app provided within the repository with code having passcode facility in it or else you can use the another code and can use any arduino controller.(easily availiable on playstore or appstore).
Don't worry about heating of relay and arduino.it's safe and tried and tested.
Here we have used our own designed hinge mechanism using threads but for ease you can use your own or can buy the lock directly from stores.
Make the connections tight as it may results in automatic disconections from bluetooth module while in use.
Make the connections accordingly given in schematic.(make changes accordingly if using components other than mentioned above)
